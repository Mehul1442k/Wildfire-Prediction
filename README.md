Utilized an image database to partition the dataset into categories of Fire and No Fire for predictive analysis on new images. Developed an algo using OpenCV and Deep Learning techniques to process on new image. Additionally, leveraged Power BI and GeoPy for visualizing geographical coordinates (Longitude/Latitude) within the dataset.
